# LastFM Globe Tracks

A fun, interactive Streamlit app that visualizes the top 5 tracks from Last.fm by country on a 3D globe. Spin the globe, hover for tooltips with track details, and select a country to see its most popular tracks from the past week, as reported by Last.fm's `geo.getTopTracks` API. Features flashy colors, cached data, and a vibrant, music-driven experience!
